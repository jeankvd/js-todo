# To-Do Raw JavaScript App
## Description
A Task list made with only JavaScript to familiarize myself with deep JavaScript concepts.
## Technologies
- JavaScript

## Issues

1. Traversing the DOM and mantaining UI and state in sync was what made this webApp challenging. jQuery and React really make this process much simple.

## Next Steps
It was a great challenge to do this webapp with only JavaScript. It was also a lot of fun! I have discovered JavaScript30 and will begin working on it so I can have a deeper understanding of JavaScript.
